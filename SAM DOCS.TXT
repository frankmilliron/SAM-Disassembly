  THESE DOCS ARE FROM THE 1982 VERSION
OF S.A.M. THE '82 VERSION REQUIRED AN
EXTRA PIECE OF HARDWARE TO OPERATE, BUT
THE NEW VERSION IS COMPLETELY SOFTWARE-
DRIVEN AND REQUIRES >NO< SPECIAL CARDS.
THE PHONETIC, STRESS, AND PUNCTUATION
DATA ARE THE SAME FOR THE TWO VERSIONS;
HOWEVER, THE ADDRESS LOCATION INFO
MAY DIFFER.


  THE PROGRAMS
  ------------

S.A.M.:
  THIS PROGRAM BOOTS AUTOMATICALLY.
IT PREPARES THE COMPUTER TO ACCEPT
SPEECH INPUT THOURGH BASIC OR MACHINE
LANGUAGE PROGRAMS. (OCCUPIES 9K)

RECITER:
  THIS IS AN ENGLISH TEXT-TO-SPEECH
PROGRAM THAT INTERFACES WITH 'S.A.M.'
(OCCUPIES 6K)

SAYIT:
  A SHORT BASIC PROGRAM THAT ALLOWS
YOU TO ENTER A STRING OF PHONEMES OR
TEXT FOR S.A.M. TO RECITE.

DEMO:
  A BASIC PROGRAM THAT DEMONSTATES
SOME OF S.A.M.'S FEATURES BY TELLING A
SHORT STORY.

SPEECHES:
  ANOTHER DEMONSTRATION PROGRAM. IT
RECITES SOME FAMOUS SPEECHES.

GUESSNUM:
  A VOCAL VERSION OF THE GAME GUESS- THE-NUMBER.


  USING S.A.M. FROM APPLESOFT
  ---------------------------

  PHONEME INPUT:

]100 SA$="AY3 AEM AH KUMPYUW3TER"
]110 CALL 38128

  ENGLISH INPUT:

]100 PRINT CHR$(4);"BLOAD RECITER"
]110 SA$="I AM A COMPUTER"
]120 CALL 38131

(NOTE: THE CALL LOCATION IS DIFFERENT!)


  SOME CAUTIONS
  -------------

  1) DON'T OVERWRITE S.A.M.'S MEMORY.
IN APPLESOFT THIS CAN BE AVOIDED BY
USING A HIMEM:29024.

  2) NEVER HIT <RESET> WHILE S.A.M. IS
SPEAKING. USE <CTRL-C> TO EXIT INSTEAD.


  PHONETIC INPUT
  --------------

  PHONETIC INPUT INCREASES THE CLARITY
OF THE SPEECH. ALSO, THE ABILITY TO
ALTER INFLECTION ADDS EMOTION AND MAKES
THE VOICE SOUND MORE NATURAL TO HUMAN
EARS.

  ADDING STRESS TO S.A.M.'S SPEECH
  --------------------------------

  S.A.M.'S STRESS CAN BE CHANGED BY
ADDING NUMBERS TO THE WORDS IN PHONEME INPUT.

  HERE IS AN EXAMPLE SHOWING DIFFERENT
WAYS OF STRESSING THE STATEMENT "WHY
SHOULD I WALK TO THE STORE?"

  1) WAY2 SHUH7D AY WAO5K TUX DHAH STOH5R. (YOU WANT THE REASON WHY.)

  2) WAY7 SHUH2D AY WAO7K TUX DHAH STOH5R. (YOU ARE RELUCTANT TO GO.)
 
  3) WAY5 SHUH7D AY2 WAO7K DHAH STOHR.
(YOU WANT SOMEONE ELSE TO DO IT.)

  4) WAY5 SHUHD AY7 WAO2K TUX7 DHAH STOHR. (YOU'D RATHER DRIVE.)

  5) WAY5 SHUHD AY WAO5K TUX DHAH STOH2OH7R. (YOU WANT TO WALK SOMEWHERE
ELSE.)

  THE STRESS MARKERS:

1= VERY EMOTIONAL STRESS
2= VERY EMPHATIC STRESS
3= RATHER STRONG STRESS
4= ORDINARY STRESS
5= LIGHT STRESS
6= NEUTRAL (NO PITCH CHANGE) STRESS
7= PITCH-DROPPING STRESS
8= EXTREME PITCH-DROPPING STRESS


  THE EFFECTS OF PUNCTUATION
  --------------------------

  S.A.M. UNDERSTANDS FOUR PUNCTUATION
MARKS: THE HYPHEN (-), THE COMMA (,),
THE PERIOD (.), AND THE QUESTION MARK
(?).
  
  THE HYPHEN (-) SERVES AS A SHORT
PAUSE. THE COMMA (,)  SERVES AS A PAUSE
ABOUT TWICE THE SIZE OF THE HYPEN. THE PERIOD (.)  SERVERS AS A PAUSE AND ALSO
CAUSES THE PITCH TO FALL. THE QUESTION
MARK (?) SERVES AS A PAUSE AND ALSO
CAUSES THE PITCH TO RISE.


  FINAL NOTE ON PHONETICS
  -----------------------

  S.A.M. IS CAPABLE OF SPEAKING ONLY
2.5 SECONDS WITHOUT A BREAK. (THAT'S
THE SIZE OF HIS BREATH.) IF THE STRING
EXCEEDS 2.5 SECONDS THEN S.A.M. WILL
PUT IN A PAUSE EVERY 2.5 SECONDS.


  PITCH AND SPEED CHANGES
  -----------------------

PITCH:

POKE PITCH, N
WHEN N EQUALS:

00-20     IMPRACTICAL
20-30     VERY HIGH
30-40     HIGH
40-50     HIGH NORMAL
50-70     NORMAL
70-80     LOW NORMAL
80-90     LOW
90-255    VERY LOW
DEFAULT=  64

SPEED:

POKE SPEED,M
WHEN M EQUALS:

00-20     INPRACTICAL
20-40     VERY FAST
40-60     FAST
60-70     FAST CONVERSATIONAL
70-75     NORMAL CONVERSATIONAL
75-90     NARRATIVE
90-100    SLOW
100-255   VERY SLOW
DEFAULT= 72



  USING KNOBS
  -----------

  TO USE KNOBS, LOAD IT JUST LIKE
RECITER. THEN YOU CAN POKE IN VALUES
BETWEEN 0 AND 255.

  KNOBS FOR S.A.M.  KNOBS FOR RECITER
